# Implement support for other databases other than SQLite
# Implement support for multiple malware hash databases
# Mult-core support for Full-System Scan since it takes fucking ages
# Option to scan sub-folders in Folder Scan (currently only scans parent folder)
# De-hardcode button names being passed to fileScan()
# Re-code File Scan and Folder Scan to be similar to Full-System Scan (getting rid of the filenames[] appends and doing it moreso on-the-fly)
# Find way to scan files that are currently being used by system (Errno 13)
# Linux support?

# I have verified that the fileScan() function works as intended by adding test files to HashDB.db
