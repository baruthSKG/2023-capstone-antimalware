# TO-DO:
# -------------------------------------------------------
# Find way to scan files that are currently being used by system (Errno 13)
# Re-code File Scan and Folder Scan to be similar to Full-System Scan (getting rid of the filenames[] appends and doing it moreso on-the-fly)
# Implement support for other databases other than SQLite
# Implement support for multiple malware hash databases
# Option to select and deselct folders
# Scan external drives
# Quarantine system


# ALREADY IMPLEMENTED:
# -------------------------------------------------------
# Implement other hashing algorithms other than MD5, MD5 is weak and can be faked easily
# Concatenate separate hash functions into one function
# Support for scanning multiple files
# De-hardcode database name in compareHashDB_SQLite() function
# Full recursive system scan
# Option to scan sub-folders in Folder Scan (currently only scans parent folder)
# Mult-core support for Full-System Scan since it takes fucking ages

# DOESN'T REALLY MATTER THAT MUCH:
# -------------------------------------------------------
# Convert to C++
# De-hardcode button names being passed to fileScan()
# Linux support?
